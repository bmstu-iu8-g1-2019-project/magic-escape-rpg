Thanks for checking out my project. This is a fully functional, RPG game, developed in Unity as a Course project. The main goal of this project is to simply learn Unity development from "zero level".

## Status and prerequisites

Current status at a glance:
```
Unity version: 209.2.13f1
Platform    : Windows
```

## Getting the project

To get the project folder you need to clone or download the project.

## Getting the right version of Unity

Once you have cloned the repository, you should install
the version of Unity that is listed above in the prerequisites section. Make
sure you include windows standalone support in your installation.

The first time you open the project you need patience! It takes a while
to import all the assets.

## More information

Check out the [Documentation](Documentation/) folder for more information. In particular, the [Getting Started Guide](Documentation/EN/GettingStarted.md) is a good place to, well, start.
